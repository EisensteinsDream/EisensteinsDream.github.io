			<p class="autodrawingheader2">I do not consider myself an adept illustrator. I still try to make one 'autodrawing' a day. The lack of expectations allows me to approach these with no filter. As to express creativity in it's most unrestrained form. I suppose you can consider it pure surrealism. Nothing in these have any intrinsic meaning, nor are they intended to resemble anything. Intention was not a factor in their creation at all.</p>

			<p class="autodrawingheader2">These are made mostly with a cheap pen. Some involve a felt pen. I do not electronically process them at all after scanning them All are drawn on regular notebook paper. Occasionally I upload these. Feel free to view them, if you like.</p>
